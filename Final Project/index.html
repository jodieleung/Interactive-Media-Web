		<h3>Some sand and turquoise water sounds really nice right now, you both agree to go this weekend.</h3>

		<h3>It's the night before! Neither of you have looked too far into where you will stay but you have your tent, packed bags, and a car.</h3>

		<h3>To get to Hornby Island you need to take three ferries. <br>You decide to be on the safe side and leave on the earliest ferry the next morning at 7:45.</h3>

		<h3>Rise and shine – it's 6:45AM</h3>
